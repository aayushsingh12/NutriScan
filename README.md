# NutriScan

Consumers are increasingly conscious of the health impact of packaged foods, yet nutrition labels remain difficult to interpret. Many products conceal harmful additives under technical names (e.g., E129, Red 40, Blue 30) or misleading terms (e.g., apple juice concentrate, natural flavors). Current labeling systems overwhelm users with numbers and jargon, offering little clarity about the food’s actual level of processing or health impact.

This creates a critical gap: despite regulations, consumers lack a simple, trustworthy way to evaluate whether a food product is minimally processed, processed, or ultra-processed, and whether it contains hidden or concerning ingredients

INTRODUCING NUTRISCAN!

The project aims to develop an AI-powered food label scanner that helps consumers see through the misleading complexity of packaged food labels. Using OCR, the system extracts label text and runs it through a classification model that assigns a health score based on the NOVA food processing standard. It then flags hidden or confusing ingredients such as artificial colorants (Red 40, Yellow 5), preservatives (sodium benzoate), and disguised sugars (apple juice concentrate, high fructose corn syrup). Additionally, it can flag ingredients that may trigger allergies or affect specific health conditions for the user.

The output is a simple, transparent summary that highlights the product’s real health impact, empowering consumers to make informed dietary choices with clarity and confidence.
